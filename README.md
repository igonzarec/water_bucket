# The Bucket Challenge

The application seeks to represent the solution to the riddle of the water buckets. It aims to follow the CLEAN architecture. It does not have a complex structure though, because the project is small and does not require any additional logic (v.g. communication with any kind of services). For the same reason, it was not necessary to implement Exception handling either. Regarding the solution of the puzzle, the core of the algorithm focuses on determining if the greatest common divisor between bucket x and bucket y is divisible by the desired amount.

It was last tested in emulators iPhone 11 and pixel 2 (API 30). It was also tested in a physical iOS device (ipad 10.2 9th generation, OS version 15.5) and in a physical android device (OS version 8.1.0).
